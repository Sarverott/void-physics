### Supporting Arguments for the Computational Universe

Here’s why we can argue the universe is computational:
A. The Physics is Rule-Based

    The fundamental laws of physics (e.g., quantum mechanics, general relativity) govern the behavior of the universe with incredible precision.
    These laws can be represented mathematically, implying they have a computational structure.
    For example, Schrödinger’s equation in quantum mechanics evolves wavefunctions over time in a manner that resembles a computation.

B. Quantum Mechanics and Information Theory

    Quantum mechanics fundamentally ties physical systems to information. For example:
        The "wavefunction collapse" represents the resolution of uncertainty into a definite state (akin to resolving a computation).
        Entanglement shows how information is shared and correlated across particles, implying a deep computational structure.
    Seth Lloyd famously argued that the universe is a quantum computer, with each interaction performing a fundamental computation.

C. The Holographic Principle

    Theoretical work, such as the holographic principle, suggests that all the information in a region of space can be encoded on its boundary. This is similar to a storage mechanism in computation, where the data of a higher-dimensional system is stored in fewer dimensions.
    Black hole entropy (via the Bekenstein-Hawking formula) provides a computational limit: the maximum amount of information that can be stored in a given region of space.

D. Simulated Universes and Turing Completeness

    If the universe is a computation, it must be Turing-complete—that is, capable of universal computation given enough time and resources. Many physicists suggest that this may indeed be the case.
    The simulation hypothesis directly supports this: if we can simulate universes in our own computational systems, it means computation is a fundamental principle of existence.

E. The "Digital Physics" Argument

    Proposed by Edward Fredkin and others, digital physics suggests that the universe operates on a discrete, computational grid (e.g., cellular automata).
    This view posits that time, space, and matter emerge from the interactions of fundamental computational units (akin to bits).

### Time as -1D and the Nature of Events

##### The Concept of -1D Time:
- Traditional physics treats time as a positive dimension (1D) that flows forward.
- However, considering time as -1D suggests:
    - It is inherently tied to quantum forces or the potential for events.
    - Time might "pull" rather than "push," acting as a contractive dimension that "unwinds" as events resolve into their final states.
    - This aligns with your argument that once an event ends, its "quantum force" (the possibilities it carries) is reduced to zero, and the past becomes irretrievable (it is, quite literally, "lost" from computation).

- Space and Events:

    - If space is a "bundle of dimensions," it could act as the substrate or medium where events are encoded and executed.
    - Events might be localized quantum computations within space, and their outcomes (particles, forces, etc.) are the "manifestations" of these computations.
